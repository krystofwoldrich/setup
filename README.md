# Set up dev env

This is a simple script that set ups my dev environment the way I like it and use it.

It's main goal is to get me up the speed when I reinstall my OS or get a new Mac.

It's also handy source of knowledge about how the tools are installed and initialized.

There is no list of installed software or changes made to the shell as it would inevitable be soon out of date.

Whoever stumbles across this repository I hope you find this inspiring to create your own script or you find it disgusting and primitive and you will be happy that you have much better way to do this.
